# HITCHHIKER ENCOUNTER - Branching Dialogue Example
# This dialogue demonstrates the branching system.
# Use: do DialogueFlow.choice("positive/neutral/negative") to set alignment
# Use: => step2_good / => step2_bad for branch-specific paths
# Or use conditions: [if DialogueFlow.is_good()] for inline branching

Stranger: Hey! You stopping? Most people just drive right past.

- Sure, hop in. #positive
	do DialogueFlow.choice("positive")
	Stranger: Finally, someone with a heart! I knew you looked decent.
	=> step2_good

- I guess... where are you headed? #neutral
	do DialogueFlow.choice("neutral")
	[if DialogueFlow.is_good()] Stranger: Just up the road. Thanks for being cool about it.
	[if DialogueFlow.is_bad()] Stranger: Does it matter? Just drive.
	[if DialogueFlow.is_good()] => step2_good
	[if DialogueFlow.is_bad()] => step2_bad

- No, I don't pick up strangers. #negative
	do DialogueFlow.choice("negative")
	Stranger: Figures. Everyone's scared these days.
	=> step2_bad

# ============ STEP 2 - GOOD BRANCH ============
~ step2_good

Stranger: You know, not many people stop anymore. It means something.
Stranger: Where you headed anyway?

- Up to the mountains, clearing my head. #positive
	do DialogueFlow.choice("positive")
	Stranger: Mountains, huh? Good place to think. I like that.
	=> step3_good

- Just driving. #neutral
	do DialogueFlow.choice("neutral")
	[if DialogueFlow.is_good()] Stranger: Sometimes that's all you need.
	[if DialogueFlow.is_bad()] Stranger: Aimless, like the rest of us.
	[if DialogueFlow.is_good()] => step3_good
	[if DialogueFlow.is_bad()] => step3_bad

- None of your business. #negative
	do DialogueFlow.choice("negative")
	Stranger: Alright, alright. Didn't mean to pry.
	=> step3_bad

# ============ STEP 2 - BAD BRANCH ============
~ step2_bad

Stranger: You don't talk much, do you? Fine by me.
Stranger: Just keep driving. I'll tell you when to stop.

- Look, I'm just trying to help. #positive
	do DialogueFlow.choice("positive")
	Stranger: ...Yeah. Sorry. Bad day, you know?
	=> step3_good

- Whatever. #neutral
	do DialogueFlow.choice("neutral")
	[if DialogueFlow.is_good()] Stranger: Fair enough.
	[if DialogueFlow.is_bad()] Stranger: Yeah, whatever.
	[if DialogueFlow.is_good()] => step3_good
	[if DialogueFlow.is_bad()] => step3_bad

- Maybe I should just drop you here. #negative
	do DialogueFlow.choice("negative")
	Stranger: Do what you want. Everyone else does.
	=> step3_bad

# ============ STEP 3 - ENDINGS ============
~ step3_good

Stranger: Hey... thanks. Really. For stopping, for listening.
Stranger: This is me up ahead. Take care of yourself, alright?
=> ending_good

~ step3_bad

Stranger: Whatever. Just pull over here.
Stranger: Don't expect a thank you.
=> ending_bad

# ============ FINAL ENDINGS ============
~ ending_good

Stranger: You're one of the good ones. Don't let the world change that.
do DialogueFlow.empathy += 10

~ ending_bad

Stranger: *slams door*
do DialogueFlow.empathy -= 10
=> END
