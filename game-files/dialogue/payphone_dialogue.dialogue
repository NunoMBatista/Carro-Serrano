**The cold metal receiver hangs on its hook, waiting.**
**Call for help?**

- Yes

- No
	=> call_no

**You lift the receiver.**
**Your fingers dial the emergency number.**
**...**
**Someone answers.**

=> END

~ call_no

**You stare at the payphone for a moment.**
**The mountain's silence returns.**
