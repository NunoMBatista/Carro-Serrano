**You approach the weathered payphone.**
**The cold metal receiver hangs on its hook, waiting.**
**Call for help?**

- Yes
	=> call_yes

- No
	=> call_no

~ call_yes

**You lift the receiver.**
**Your fingers dial the emergency number.**
**The line rings once... twice...**
**Someone answers.**

=> END

~ call_no

**You stare at the payphone for a moment.**
**Then turn away.**
**The mountain's silence returns.**

=> END
