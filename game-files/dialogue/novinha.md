## Start Dialogue

*The door slowly opens, and the mountain's frost floods the car.*
*A small figure sheepishly climbs into the passenger seat, and carefully closes the door.*
*Her eyes have been holding back tears of despair, and her voice quivers as she calms herself.*

{
Thank you so much, I don't think I would last much longer on this cold.

I.. I'm sorry, I was just getting scared out there...
The fog came in out of nowhere.. it was so sunny just minutes ago..
My phone wasn't getting any signal.. And the other drivers didn't even stop.. How can people be so cruel..
I'm sorry for the trouble. Thank you very much for helping me.
}

*The hitchhiker takes deep breaths, slowly and surely regaining composure*
*She wipes away her teary eyes, and bravelly regains composure*

{
Thank you again.
How strange, I've lived on these mountains 19 years, and never before has the weather taken such a drastic and sudden turn for the worst.
It's as if the mountain herself senses that something terrible is about to go down, and has hidden her face in fear.

Lots of tourists taking the day off to go visit the Towers, I assume you're going there too?
Oh! I'm sorry, I didn't even ask where you were going. I don't want you to make any inconvenient detour, just drop me off where it's most convenient please...
}

**CHOICE:**
	1. I'm going to the Towers on the very top. I'll drop you at your exit, I'm not taking any detours
		- This is negative, because she clearly needs your help, and you lose nothing by taking extra steps to help
	2. I'm going to the Towers on the very top. I don't mind the detour, I'd rather know you got home safe.
		- This is positive, shows you care, and reinforces the idea that you need to help others to help yourself
	3. I'm sorry, I'm getting second thoughts about this. Please leave *kick her out*
		- This is VERY negative, as you are throwing an already scared person out on the fog

## Negative Path 1 (No detours.)

*The hitchhiker shrinks in her seat, as if wanting to dissapear.*

{
No no.. of course.. I don't.. I really don't want to be a bother.. I'm sorry.. Thank you again for picking me out... It's still a great help...

Don't worry... I you are going straight ahead, my house is just on the side of the road, hidden in the trees. There's no need to take any exits.
}

*The car falls into awkward silence.*
*She opens and closes her mouth to speak several times, trying to break the silence.*

{
I'm sorry, this is just something I've been thinking a lot lately.

You were really kind to help me. I wish there was something I could give you as thanks. It bothers me feeling like I owe you one.
I guess it's only natural to need outside help sometimes.
We were not made to live alone.
}

---
## Negative Path 1 (Happy to help.)

*The hitchhiker exhales in relief, now sitting confortably on her seat.*

{
Thank... Thanks for being so understanding.
I'm really lucky you were passing by. People seem hesitant to help others,

There's really no need for taking exits though, my house is just on the side of this road, hidden by the trees. I'll warn you when we get close.
}

*She ponders for a short moment*

{
I find it admirable, that mentality.
The world sometimes seems so terrible and unforgiving. It's no wonder that people so often default to measuring "strength" by the "ability to cause harm".
I believe strength is more "the will to change terrible situations". Just like you said!

You had the means to help me out of my situation, and were happy to do so, even if it was inconvenient.
Huh.. What I mean is..
I think we don't give ourselves enough credit. Being able to help others is a sign and show of strength.
I'm sorry for making assumptions, but looking at you, I think you are stronger than you realise.
}

*She ponders again*

{
I'm sorry, this is just something I've been thinking about a lot lately.

You were really kind to help me. I wish there was something I could help you with too.
# I think it's only natural need help. There's also in our very core a want to help others too.
I think that in everyone exists a desire to help others... Perhaps in the hopes that they can help us too...
We were not made to live alone.
}

**CHOICE:**
	1. Helping makes me feel useful
		- This is positive, because its vulnerable
	2. Relying on others just makes things harder in the long run.
		- This is negative. You have to rely on others at least sometimes (like asking for help for suicide).
	3. I don’t want to talk about this. Please get out. *kick her out*
		- This is VERY negative, as you are throwing an already scared person out on the fog

## Positive Path 2 (helping make me feel useful)

*Her eyes betray that she's remembering something*

{
…Yeah. I get that.

There was a time when I didn’t really know what I was doing with my life. No big tragedy. Just… stuck.

I started helping out at the little café near my house. Covering shifts. Cleaning up after closing.
Nothing important.
}

*Pause*

{
But people started recognizing me.
Asking how my day was.
Trusting me with small things.
}

*She looks at you without her previous fear*

{
It didn’t suddenly make me happy. But it made me feel real again. Like I wasn’t just passing through my own life.
By opening yourself up to strangers, they will sometimes open themselves up back at you.

We all need help one way or another sometimes, and we all can provide that help to others when they can't help themselves.
}

{...}

{
That’s my place. You can stop right here, if you don't mind...
Thank you again for the help. It was really nice talking to you.
}

---
## Negative Path 2 (don't rely on others)

{
That’s fair...

I guess… if you never expect help, you never have to be disappointed.
It can feel safer that way.
}

*She seems to reconsider her answer*

{
Can you really live like that forever?
After a while, it starts to feel like you’re carrying everything alone.
Even the things that were never meant to be carried by one person.

Relying on someone isn’t about making things easier. It’s about survival.
}

{...}

{
That’s my place. You can stop right here, if you don't mind...
Thank you again for the help. I hope I did not sound too weird.
}

**CHOICE:**
	1. I’m glad I could help. I think I needed it too.
		- This is positive, because its vulnerable and true.
	2. You don’t owe me anything...
		- This is negative because it's dismissive.

## Positive Path 3 (i needed it too)

*Her eyes lighten up for the first time*

{
Ye- Yeah, I'm glad I could be of some comfort.
}

*Door opens slowly, and the moutain air once again rushes to frost you*
*She smiles back at you*

{
That makes me think...
Maybe that's another reason why we try to help others:
Even if we don't realise it... We want to make sure that we can still help ourselves.
}

*Door closes gently*

---
## Negative Path 3 (i needed it too)

{
...
}

*Door opens slowly, and the moutain air once again rushes to frost you*
*She looks back at you with some sadness*

{
I... I don't think you got it, did you?

Still... I hope I could be of some comfort...
}

*Door closes gently*
