*They slowly reach for the handle and open the door.*
*Yet again, the frosty breeze makes its way in.*
*..*
*It's a man.. old with rough and trimmed silver hair, seemingly unbothered by the biting cold.*
*He sits and.. one by one.. puts his stiff legs into the car, shutting the door with just enough force.*

{
Deepest thanks, truly.. these old knees of mine really started winning the argument halfway up the trail.
There really is no point arguing with them, these days. 
Used to tell 'em 'just one more mile' and they’d listen.
Now?.. Now they just start screaming back at me until I’m forced to listen to them instead!
}

*The old man looks cheerful. Despite his complaint, there is a light smile on his face*
*He looks around attentively at each corner of the car*
*Then, locks his gaze on you*

{
You’ve got a heavy grip on that steering wheel, son.
And an even heavier look behind those eyes. 
Whatever you’re carrying up this mountain.. it looks like it weighs more than this car.
}

**CHOICE:**
	1. I guess I've had a lot on my mind lately. It's been a long road.
		- This is marked as positive. The protagonist recognizes not everything is going well and is a little open about it
	2. I'm just focused. It has been a long road and I don't want to make any wrong turns.
		- This is marked as negative, it's dismissive but not rude or insulting
	3. Don't talk much, it's distracting and i'm trying not to go the wrong way.
		-This is marked as more negative, it's not only dismissive but rude towards someone who is clearly being sympathetic
    4. Actually, I have changed my mind. I cannot take you with me, please get out. *kicks him out*
        -This is VERY negative. The old man is physically incapable of doing the trail alone, and you knowingly leave him in the side of the road.

## Positive Path 1 (Open)

*The man now looks through the windshield, into the misty road*
*He sighs*
*His joyful tone is now just a little more wistful*

{
 I suppose it has been. 
 But, you know.. sometimes it's not that the road is long..
 Maybe it feels long because you're tired of carrying so much luggage with you.. it adds up over time."
}

## Negative Path 2 (Dismissive)
*The man now looks through the windshield, into the misty road*
*He keeps his joyful tone*

{
I hear you, son.. sometimes the engine is too loud for talk anyway.
..
But I wouldn't worry too much about going the wrong way. 
There are always routes you can pick that get you back on track and.. luckily.. 
I happen to know them all!
}

*He now keeps a proud smile on his face*

{
Feel free to ask if you need any help..
After all.. the best travelers sometimes need someone to hold the map. 
And I feel.. 
I feel you might need someone to do that for you, don't you?"
}

**CHOICE:**
	1. Well, I guess you're right... but how would you know?
		-This is positive. Agrees that the oldman is right is might try helping you. You seem open to that
	2. Whatever man, if you say so.
		-This is negative. You still dismiss the subject don't listen.
	3. I didn't pick you up for a therapy session, did I? Get out of my car. *kicks him out*
		-This is VERY negative. The old man is physically incapable of doing the trail alone, and you knowingly leave him in the side of the road.

## Positive Path 2 (How would you know?)
*He lets out a giggle*
{
Well, let's just say.. I've always been a man who took pride in his own two legs.
For as long as I can remember, I've walked these trails back and forth.. never needing a soul to help me along the way. 
But time..
}
*His bright voice now becomes more grim*

{
oh..
..
time weighs.
And yet, I stubbornly kept my ways.. tackling this climb alone.
But then comes the day.. you can no longer hold that weight.
And you..
You look like you can no longer hold it by yourself.
}

--
## Negative Path 2 (Dismissive)
{
Well, you don't have to be such a tough nut to crack, do you? 
But who am I to judge.. I used to have that stubborness with me too up until recently. 
Took me a while.. but it eventually gave in.
..
You see.. I've walked these tracks for as long as I can remember.
And I took pride.. so much pride in my ability to climb this whole thing..
Fast.. faster than anyone!
}
*His bright voice now becomes more grim*
{
But time.. is weighing too much.
And you..
Whatever it is that you're carrying with you..
Looks just as heavy.
}

**CHOICE:**
	1. I’m too close to the summit now. It’s a bit late in the climb to start looking for a hand to hold, don't you think?.
        -Positive. Challenges what the man is saying, but in a engaging way, shows interest
	2. Thank you for sharing that. I'm glad you overcame that stubborness of yours in time.
		-This is positive. 
	3. It's too late for me. There's nothing you can do. I'm almost at the peak, anyway.
        -Negative. Refusal.
	4. Stop being so pityful, it's annoying. I'm just gonna leave you here, get out. *kicks him out*
        -This is VERY negative. The old man is physically incapable of doing the trail alone, and you knowingly leave him in the side of the road.

## Positive Path 3 
*He calmly laughs*

{
Ahah.. it's never too late, my friend.
You have this stubborn old soul sitting next you..
Who finally became a little less stubborn.. and asked for help for the first time..
Today!
For the first time.. i'm not climbing alone.. and asked for help.
And now.. how I wish I had done that sooner..
..
Oh!
Wait, stop.. wer're here!
You can drop me off here.
Thank you traveler, for your help!
Be on your way now..
And don't forget.. 
#There's no shame in catching a ride when the road gets long.
}

*Just as slowly as he got in, the man left the car*
*This time, he closes it firmly*

--
## Negative Path 3
*His look becomes gloomier*
*His voice, more somber*

{
There really is nothing I can do, son.
Only you can.. 
You always can.
..
Oh!
Wait, stop.. wer're here!
You can drop me off here.
Thank you traveler, for your help!
Be on your way now..
And don't forget.. 
There's no shame in catching a ride when the road gets long."
}

*Just as slowly as he got in, the man left the car*
*This time, he closes it firmly*
